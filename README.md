📌 Inspiration

Families living near forest borders often face unexpected wildlife encounters, especially at night. Traditional safety methods—like fire, shouting, and crackers—are unsafe, polluting, and can cause forest fires.

We wanted a safe, eco-friendly, STEM-powered solution that protects people without harming wildlife. This inspired the creation of the Eco-Alert Torch, a clean-tech safety tool meant for rural and forest-fringe communities.

🔦 What It Does

The Eco-Alert Torch is a portable night-time safety device that uses:

High-intensity red strobe lights

Artificial flame LED visuals

Safe alert sound patterns

Rechargeable battery system

(Optional) IoT motion detection and basic alerting

It helps users deter approaching wildlife safely, improving visibility and night-time security while ensuring no animal is harmed.

🛠️ How We Built It

Research on wildlife behavior and safe deterrent techniques

Electronic design using high-power LEDs, speaker modules, and microcontrollers

Programming light/sound patterns using Arduino/ESP32

Prototype assembly with rechargeable battery and handheld casing

STEM Extension:

Motion sensors

IoT alerts using ESP32 Wi-Fi

Dashboard for viewing detection events

The device is designed to be safe, sustainable, and easy for anyone to use.
